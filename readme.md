A comprehensive Python project demonstrating essential file operations and error handling techniques.

## 📋 Features

- 📖 File reading with robust error handling
- ✍️ File writing and appending operations
- 🛡️ Comprehensive exception handling
- 📊 Line-by-line file processing
- 🔄 Interactive user input handling

## 🚀 Task 1: File Reading with Error Handling

### 📋 Description
Demonstrates reading from a text file with graceful error handling.

### 📝 Usage
```bash
python task1.py
```

### 📋 Expected Behavior
- ✅ If file exists: Prints content line by line
- ❌ If file does not exist: Shows error message

### 🔍 Code Analysis
```python
try:
    with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
        print("File content:")
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'sample.txt' does not exist.")
```

## 📝 Task 2: File Writing and Appending

### 📋 Description
Demonstrates file writing and appending operations with user input.

### 📝 Usage
```bash
python task2.py
```

### 📋 Steps
1. Enter text to write to file
2. Enter additional text to append
3. View the final content

### 🔍 Code Analysis
```python
def write_and_append():
    user_input = input("Enter some text to write to the file: ")
    
    try:
        with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
            file.write(user_input + "\n")
            print("Text written to file successfully!")
        
        additional_data = input("Enter additional text to append: ")
        with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
            file.write(additional_data + "\n")
            print("Additional text appended successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```
